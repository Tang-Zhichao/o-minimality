This note will have two branchs where the only difference is the formatting,

the main branch is a common plain typesetting with ams article class,

while the kao-template branch is, as the name suggests, 
a typesetting with the [kaobook](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook) package.

To use the kaobook template, the font familes Libertinus and Liberation must be installed.

The contents of the two branch may not be synchronized in time,
please take care.
