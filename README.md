This note will have two branchs where the only difference is the formatting,
the main branch is a common typesetting,
while the kao-template branch is, as the name suggests, 
a typesetting with the [kaobook package](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook).

To use the kaobook template, the font familes Libertinus and Liberation must be installed.
